        <p>MumMoment is a personalized pregnancy wellness platform designed to support expectant mothers with tailored 
            diet plans, daily health reminders, pregnancy tracking, fitness guidance, and real-time access to healthcare experts.
            <br><br>
            The goal was to address key challenges faced by pregnant women such as inconsistent nutrition, lack of exercise motivation, 
            difficulty accessing credible medical advice, and emotional isolation. Through a human-centered design process, we developed 
            an intuitive mobile experience that balances care, convenience, and community supportâ€”all while prioritizing data privacy 
            and inclusivity.

    Many pregnant women struggle with a lack of personalized guidance and holistic support during their journey. 
    Through our early research and interviews, we discovered several challenges including:
  </p>
  <ul class="skills-list">
    <li>Inconsistent nutrition and exercise routines</li>
    <li>Difficulties accessing reliable medical advice</li>
    <li>Lack of real-time support from experts</li>
    <li>Emotional isolation, especially for first-time mothers</li>
    <li>Overload of unfiltered and conflicting online information</li>

    <h2>User Interview</h2>
    <p>We conducted interviews with 6 pregnant women to understand their needs and concerns. 
        Key findings included a desire for personalized advice, reliable resources, and emotional support.</p>

      <h2>User Research and Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>
         We conducted 6 interviews with pregnant women across different trimesters to explore their needs, emotions, and habits.
          Most desired trusted advice, personal wellness tracking, and emotional support in one place.

      <h2>Persona and Visual Design</h2>
      <p>
        To ensure we designed a solution that resonated with our users, we started by defining a clear user persona and crafting a
        visual language that aligns with their expectations and emotional needs. These foundational steps helped guide all design
        decisions throughout the project.
        <br>
        We created a clean, calming visual identity using soft colors, rounded UI elements, and accessible fonts. This visual style 
        was tested for readability and emotional resonance with pregnant users.

<div class="Wireframes">
    <h2>Wirefrems</h2>
    <p> After validating our low-fidelity sketches through early feedback, we developed mid-fidelity wireframes to define layout, navigation,
    and key interactions in more detail. These wireframes helped us focus on content structure and user flow without distractions of final
    visual styling. We tested the designs with users to refine functionality before moving to high-fidelity prototypes.
